Create a system architecture **mermaid** diagram for the Agile Team MCP Server. 

The diagram should illustrate:

1. The main components of the MCP server system
2. How different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) integrate with the system
3. The data flow from user requests through the tool interfaces
4. How responses are processed and returned

Include explanatory text for each component in the diagram.

The diagram should be suitable for inclusion in technical documentation and should help new developers understand the overall architecture.

Provide the diagram in the requested format along with a brief explanation of the key components.
